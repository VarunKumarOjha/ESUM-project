# ESUM-project
ESUM: This research is a part of our research project "ESUM-Analysing trade­offs between the energy and social performance of urban morphologies," at the Chair of Information Architecture, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland and the Chair of Computer Science for Architecture, Bauhaus University Weimar, Germany.

We, a team of researchers at ETH Zurich, Switzerland and Bauhaus­ University Weimar, Germany, applied Machine Learning methods to investigating how humans perceive their urban environment and what features of urban environment influence the humans' physiological arousal states. For this purpose, we conducted a study, where participants took a leisure walk in an urban environment. Empirical measures of participants' physiological conditions and urban environment features were analyzed using Machine Learning methods.
